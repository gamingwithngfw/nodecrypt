# nodecrypt
gaming.txt - List related to gaming that break when ssl decrypted. 
This is the main focus for this mini-project. 

other.txt - List not related to gaming that break when ssl decrypted. 
Others have better lists for this but had to have a place for what I detect somewhere.

steam.txt - Valve and steam spesific info. Not only for ssl decrypt

blizzard.txt - Blizzard spesific info. Not only for ssl decrypt
